# README GENERATOR
---

### Demo
![commandline-demo](./Assets/images/commandline-demo.jpg)

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Technologies used 

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Inquirer 

## Installation 

1. Git clone this repository onto your local machine and navigate to the file on your terminal. *This can also be done by opening the file on Visual Studios and running it through the intergated terminal.*

2. In order for the app to function correctly, ensure you have the latest or most stable version of Node.js and that you've run:
- `npm install`
- `npm install inquirer`
- `npm install moment --save`

3. Run `node index.js` and follow the prompts that run on your terminal. This will then generate your very own README file for your project.
